            <p>The earliest structures known in the immediate area are four or five pits, three of which appear to have held large pine totem-pole like posts erected in the Mesolithic period, between 8500 and 7000 BC.[1] It is not known how these posts relate to the later monument of Stonehenge. Within the bank and ditch were possibly some timber structures and set just inside the bank were 56 pits, known as the Aubrey Holes. There has been much debate about what stood in these holes. </p>

            <h3>Kansas City landlords fault city officials for letting KC Tenants set housing agenda</h3> 
            <img src="news%20img.jpg" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12 ">
            <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Robert Long has about had it with being a landlord in Kansas City. “If I sell my homes, they will not be sold to another investor,” he said, “they’ll be sold to owner-occupants because Kansas City doesn’t deserve to have rental properties.” As the group KC Tenants has grown, both in visibility and City Hall successes, Long is among the critics who have pushed back on many of its initiatives. There already was too much regulation and bias against landlords in a city where 46 percent of the population rents, he said. And it’s only gotten worse since the advocacy group came on the scene in 2019, he said, tipping the power balance even more toward the rights of renters. First came the requirement that rental property be registered, then in 2018 voters overwhelmingly approved the Healthy Homes initiative, which gave city inspectors the right to enter rental properties in response to complaints about things like mold and cockroaches, as well as make unannounced visits to inspect properties to check on suspected hazards. Landlords were required to pay a fee per unit as part of that initiative.</p>
